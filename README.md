###### What is Vibrancy?
> Vibrancy is a WYSIWIG text editor made for the Rival Regions article system. It implements a modified form of BBCode, a mark-up 
> language made for web forums. Check out BBCode and phpBB at https://www.bbcode.org/ and https://www.phpbb.com/ respectively. Vibrancy
> includes all the text-formatting tools present in an easy-to-use and stable program.

###### What is WYSIWIG?
> WYSIWIG stands for What You See is What You Get. In essence, what you see when you type and format your text is what is displayed in 
> your article when you copy over the output, which will be in BBCode. It allows for seamless creation of articles with no knowledge of
> BBCode needed, and without the hassle of inserting all the syntax.

##### What is Rival Regions?
> Rival Regions is a geopolitical simulator available on the browser (at https://rivalregions.com/), and on iOS and Android. 
> In my opinion, it's definitely flawed. The admin neglects game development and it's buggy. But the community is gold and the article 
> system makes up one of its core backbones. If you would like to try it for yourself, I will warn you that its a difficult game. Try to 
> get connections and learn new things!

Thanks for using Vibrancy!
